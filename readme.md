This is a wrapper of [Cacheman](https://github.com/cayasso/cacheman) that implements fuzzy logic to flush data.

## Usage

Create a new instance with default TTL (*Time To Live*) and defining the engine:

```js
var fuchy = new Fuchy('app', {
  ttl: 3600,
  engine: 'redis'
});
```

You can filter the keys that you don't want store in cache:

```js
var fuchy = new Fuchy('app', {
  ttl: 3600,
  engine: 'redis',
  noCacheKeys: ['creditCard']
});

fuchy.set('creditCard', '123456789101112', function (err, value) {
  // Avoiding to cache a credit card
});
```

Take a look to Cacheman [readme](https://github.com/cayasso/cacheman) to read about all methods.
